### What's cool in new gallery
1. The gallery has clear segment division -> There are different sections for Workbooks, Public Templates, and My Templates.
2. The gallery shows a lot more metadata compared to what we had in old gallery. ex. tags, description, resource groups, region, shared state etc.
3. The user can see all items in gallery without clicking on the 'Open' button that we had in old gallery
4. The columns in grids are sortable. So user can sort the rows say by last modified time, name, category etc.
5. Earlier user could only filter by name or subscriptions. In new gallery, user can filter by Workbook/template name or template category, subscriptions and resource groups.
